## what?
This is a project for me to learn and create my own raster image format. That's it, don't use this. It's completely uncompressed.

## why?
In practicality, it isn't seen as a good thing to reinvent the wheel, but how are you supposed to understand it and why you need it when you make it yourself?

## where?
This will go nowhere other than maybe in my other "made from scratch" projects.

## how?
Gonna learn how to read and encode binary and as it is compared to plaintext. all image formats are is just standardized method of encoding/decoding images, that's it, there's really nothing inherent. So this will come with low-cost high-performance ways to decode/encode, and hopefully even convert to and from png's once I take this far enough. So technically you could use this, but like, why?
